Fade2D, v1.82, 2020, Nov. 15th
==============================

Welcome to the Fade2D Library!

The present download contains all library versions for
 
.) Windows (VS2010, VS2012, VS2013, VS2015, VS2017, VS2019) 
.) Linux (gcc) for x86_64 and Raspberry PI (ARMv6, ARMv7)
.) Apple (clang)

Documentation: http://www.geom.at/fade2d/html



Getting started
===============

This software package contains small C++ example source codes
that cover the different topics. They are documented here:
http://www.geom.at/fade-delaunay-triangulation/

Find instructions for compiling with Visual Studio OR 
for Linux/Apple below. 


* Visual Studio:
----------------
Open a solution file 

  examples_2D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_2D.sln   
  examples_25D/vs20xx_exampleProject/examples_25D.sln   

For maximum performance compile in x64 Release mode. Find the executable 
in fadeRelease/x64 and run it in a command line window (cmd.exe). When
you link the library with your own software you can use the same settings
that you find in the example solutions. 

VS2010 - version 10 - toolset v100 or Windows7.1SDK
VS2012 - version 11 - toolset v110 
VS2013 - version 12 - toolset v120
VS2015 - version 14 - toolset v140
VS2017 - version 15 - toolset v141
VS2019 - version 16 - toolset v142

* Linux and Apple users: 
------------------------
cd examples_2D   (or examples_25D)

* In the Makefile, choose your Linux distribution or Apple (if a specific 
Linux distro is not listed use a similar one). Be sure libgmp is installed.

$> make
$> ./allExamples_2D   (or ./allExamples_25D)





Directories
===========

.) include_fade2d and include_fade25d
Header files of Fade2D and Fade25D

.) x64 (Win32)
The *.dll and *.lib files. This is also the output directory for the
example executables compiled with Visual Studio.

.) lib_${DISTRO}_${ARCHITECTURE}
The shared libraries (*.so) for Linux and (*.dylib) Apple developers. The 
libraries work for a wide range of Linux distributions. Commercial users 
who need support for a certain additional Linux distribution: Please get 
in contact with the author. 

.) examples_2D
Source code of all examples using Fade2D

.) examples_25D
Source code of all examples using Fade2.5D

Student license
===============

Fade is free of charge for personal non-commercial research. But we ask 
you to put a link to Fade on your research homepage or project page and to 
cite Fade2D in scientific publications using it. Fade is not free software. 
Do not integrate it in a free software project without explicit permission.

Limits of the student version:
------------------------------
2D triangulation: 1 million points
2.5D triangulation: 100 000 points
Meshing: 50 000 output triangles
Cut&Fill: 10 000 triangles
SegmentChecker: 50 000 segments

Not enough for evaluation purposes? Ask the author (bkorn@geom.at) for an 
extended evaluation license if your project requires larger limits. Please 
describe your project and include a link to your research homepage. 


Commercial license
==================

All other applications, including commercial in-house usage, require a 
commercial license which has the advantage of maintenance, error corrections 
and personal support. The commercial license of Fade consists of one base 
component and several optional components:

* The Fade2D base component (mandatory): It covers 2D Delaunay triangulations 
and constrained Delaunay triangulations. Zones and the SegmentChecker module
are included. 

* The mesh generator and grid mesher (optional): Creates high quality triangles 
inside a specified area. The methods refine() and refineAdvanced() belong to 
this component.

* The Fade2.5D extension (optional): (x,y,z)-coordinates (2.5D) and
additional algorithms for terrains and other height fields.

* The Cut&Fill software for earthwork calculations (optional): Cut-And-Fill 
computes the volume between two overlapping TINâ€™s.

* The Segment Checker module is included in the base component but also 
available as a separate component without Delaunay triangulation: Given
a set of 2D or 2.5D line segments it identifies intersecting segments.
