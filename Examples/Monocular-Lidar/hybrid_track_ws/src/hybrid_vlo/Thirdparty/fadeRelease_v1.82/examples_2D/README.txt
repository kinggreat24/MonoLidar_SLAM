Makefile Users
--------------

Make sure libgmp is installed. Edit the Makefile and choose
Apple or your Linux distro. Choose a similar distro if your
specific one is not listed e.g. use CentOS for RedHat. Then
type make to compile the examples. 

Visual Studio Users
-------------------

Open the solution file vs20xx_exampleProject/*.sln with Visual Studio.
For best performance compile in x64 Release mode, find the executable
in the fadeRelease_vXX/x64 folder and start it from the command line
(cmd.exe)
